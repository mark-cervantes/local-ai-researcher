# Researcher MCP Sprint Plan

## Overview

This sprint plan replaces the legacy execution story with the canonical Researcher MCP v1 direction from `vault/ai/docs/`. The backlog now treats the current codebase as a partial baseline that must be validated and realigned around OpenCode-first stdio delivery, self-hosted SearXNG plus self-hosted `jina-ai/reader`, full-content-by-default reads, request-scoped dedup, optional SQLite cache, and the mandatory security/privacy baseline.

| 10.02 | Enforce contract coverage for gather and health | test | M | 08.02, 09.02, 10.01 | - |

## Wave 5 - Optional Cache And Packaging Prep

## Dependency Graph

```text
06.01 -> 07.01 -> 08.01 -> 08.02 -> 10.02 -> 12.02
      -> 07.02 -> 09.01 -> 09.02 -> 10.02
      -> 07.03 -> 08.01
                  -> 09.01

08.01 + 09.01 -> 10.01 -> 11.01 -> 11.02
                         -> 12.01 -> 12.03 -> 12.02
10.01 -> 10.02
```

## Critical Path

`06.01 -> contract reset (07.01/07.02/07.03) -> 09.01 -> 10.01 -> 10.02 -> 12.02`

This is the minimum serial chain because the reader lane carries the largest behavior change from the current excerpt-first baseline into the canonical full-content-default release posture.

## Parallelism Notes

- Wave 2 is intentionally split into three independent contract tasks so content defaults, response metadata, and safety/privacy rules can advance together after baseline validation.
- Wave 3 keeps the SearXNG and reader lanes parallel once the shared contract reset is done.
- Wave 5 keeps optional cache work off the release critical path; packaging can begin as soon as schemas are frozen.

## Scope Resets From Legacy Plan

- Remove the legacy assumption that Waves 1-3 are complete enough to skip replanning; the canonical docs now define the source of truth.
- Remove excerpt-first behavior as an approved default; full content is now the locked default unless truncation or excerpting is explicitly requested.
- Remove backlog scope that implied local/custom source expansion, alternate transports, or other non-v1 directions.
- Treat optional SQLite cache as explicit follow-on scope instead of implicit global caching.

## Done Definition For This Plan

- Every backlog task below maps to the canonical RMCP wave structure and keeps traceability through `rmcp_id`.
- Dependencies are explicit enough for later tech-lead enrichment and orchestrator dispatch.
- No product code, docs under `docs/`, or files under `vault/ai/docs/` are changed by this planning refresh.

## Wave 4.5 - Provider Interface Refactor

| ID | Title | Type | Cx | Depends | Parallel With |
|----|-------|------|----|---------|---------------|
| 13.01 | Define provider interfaces and align concrete providers | refactor | M | - | - |
| 13.02 | Retype tool factories to provider contracts | refactor | M | 13.01 | - |

### Dependency Addendum

```text
13.01 -> 13.02
```

### Critical Path Addendum

`13.01 -> 13.02`

### Parallelism Notes

- No safe parallel split is planned inside Wave 4.5 because the tool-layer typing depends on the shared provider contract being established first.
- Wave 4.5 is intentionally behavior-neutral and should preserve the same passing build and test gates recorded for Wave 4.

## Wave 6 - Baseline Quality Wins

| ID | Title | Type | Cx | Depends | Parallel With |
|----|-------|------|----|---------|---------------|
| 14.01 | Tune SearXNG relevance defaults | feat | S | - | 14.02 |
| 14.02 | Detect degraded read results | feat | M | - | 14.01 |

## Wave 7 - Reader Extraction Resilience

| ID | Title | Type | Cx | Depends | Parallel With |
|----|-------|------|----|---------|---------------|
| 14.03 | Tune Jina Reader for JS-heavy pages | feat | M | 14.02 | - |

## Wave 8 - Gather Synthesis Upgrade

| ID | Title | Type | Cx | Depends | Parallel With |
|----|-------|------|----|---------|---------------|
| 14.04 | Improve gather synthesis quality | feat | M | 14.01, 14.02, 14.03 | - |

## Dependency Addendum - Quality Improvements

```text
14.01 -> 14.04
14.02 -> 14.03 -> 14.04
14.02 ---------> 14.04
```

## Critical Path Addendum - Quality Improvements

`14.02 -> 14.03 -> 14.04`

This is the minimum serial chain because degraded-read semantics must be defined before JS-heavy tuning can be evaluated cleanly, and the gather synthesis upgrade depends on the final read-quality signals.

## Parallelism Notes - Quality Improvements

- Wave 6 starts with the highest-signal, lowest-effort wins: search relevance tuning and degraded-read detection can begin immediately in parallel.
- Wave 7 stays isolated after 14.02 because reader tuning and degraded-read semantics are likely to touch the same read-path behavior and should not race.
- Wave 8 is intentionally sequenced after the search and read improvements so synthesis can rely on improved ranking inputs and explicit degraded-read visibility.

## Build Exit Backlog Normalization — 2026-04-01

- Completed epic wrappers `06` through `12` were moved out of `vault/sprint/backlog/` because every executable child task for those epics is already in `vault/sprint/done/`.
- Epic `14` was removed from `vault/sprint/backlog/` as a stale non-executable wrapper; the remaining executable scope is fully captured by Task `14.04` and this plan addendum.
- Recent ecosystem-only updates to research routing guidance and the MCP label rename from `web-reader` to `zai-web-reader` are treated as already-complete non-product work and are not represented as remaining build backlog.
- Remaining actionable backlog after normalization: none.

## Build Exit — 2026-04-01

- Task `14.04 Improve gather synthesis quality` is complete, verified, and moved to `vault/sprint/done/`.
- Verification evidence recorded for Build exit: `src/tools/gather.test.ts` task coverage passed, full suite passed (`615 passed`), and independent verification completed successfully.
- `vault/sprint/backlog/` now contains no executable tasks.
- `vault/sprint/ongoing/` remains empty.
- Sprint state is ready to exit Build and enter Integrate.

## Wave 9 - v2 Stability and Extraction

| ID | Title | Type | Cx | Depends | Parallel With |
|----|-------|------|----|---------|---------------|
| 15.01 | Add provider governance baseline | chore | M | - | 15.03 |
| 15.02 | Add Scrapling extract lane MVP | feat | L | 15.01 | - |
| 15.03 | Update v2 operator and product docs | docs | M | 15.01, 15.02 | - |

## Dependency Addendum - v2 Stability and Extraction

```text
15.01 -> 15.02 -> 15.03
15.01 ----------> 15.03
```

## Critical Path Addendum - v2 Stability and Extraction

`15.01 -> 15.02 -> 15.03`

This chain is the minimum serial path because the Scrapling lane depends on the provider-governance baseline, and the final docs must describe the implemented contract rather than a speculative shape.

## Parallelism Notes - v2 Stability and Extraction

- Provider manifest work and top-level doc planning can begin together, but implementation serialized on the governance shape to keep runtime diagnostics and docs aligned.
- Scrapling provider bridge, tool contract, and tests were treated as one coordinated implementation lane because they share the same artifact boundary.
- Final docs were refreshed after verification so examples match the shipped tool surface.

## Integration [Wave 9] — 2026-04-09
Commands: pnpm typecheck | pnpm test | pnpm build | python3 -m py_compile scripts/scrapling_bridge.py | pnpm lint
Typecheck: PASS

Build:     PASS
Bridge:    PASS — Python bridge syntax valid
Lint:      PASS — placeholder script
Status:    CLEAN
Gate:      PASS

## Wave 10 - Dockerized Scrapling Distribution Refactor

| ID | Title | Type | Cx | Depends | Parallel With |
|----|-------|------|----|---------|---------------|
| 16.01 | Redesign Scrapling provider runtime around Docker auto-detection | feat | L | - | 16.03 |
| 16.02 | Refactor extract lane from host Python bridge to Docker sidecar | refactor | L | 16.01 | - |
| 16.03 | Update startup/distribution docs for optional Docker scraping | docs | M | 16.01, 16.02 | - |

## Dependency Addendum - Dockerized Scrapling Distribution Refactor

```text
16.01 -> 16.02 -> 16.03
16.01 ----------> 16.03
```

## Critical Path Addendum - Dockerized Scrapling Distribution Refactor

`16.01 -> 16.02 -> 16.03`

This chain is the minimum serial path because the runtime model and detection rules must be locked before the extract provider can be safely refactored, and the final docs must describe the actual shipped distribution path.

## Parallelism Notes - Dockerized Scrapling Distribution Refactor

- Runtime-policy and compose design can be reasoned about before implementation, but the code refactor itself should stay serialized because startup detection, health reporting, and provider wiring all share the same artifact boundary.
- Documentation can draft alongside implementation notes but should finalize only after the new Docker-first path is verified.
