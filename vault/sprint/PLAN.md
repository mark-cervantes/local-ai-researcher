# Researcher MCP Sprint Plan

## Overview

This sprint plan replaces the legacy execution story with the canonical Researcher MCP v1 direction from `vault/ai/docs/`. The backlog now treats the current codebase as a partial baseline that must be validated and realigned around OpenCode-first stdio delivery, self-hosted SearXNG plus self-hosted `jina-ai/reader`, full-content-by-default reads, request-scoped dedup, optional SQLite cache, and the mandatory security/privacy baseline.

## Wave 1 - Baseline Validation

## Wave 4 - Schema Freeze

| ID | Title | Type | Cx | Depends | Parallel With |

## Wave 5 - Optional Cache And Packaging Prep

| ID | Title | Type | Cx | Depends | Parallel With |
|----|-------|------|----|---------|---------------|
| 11.01 | Add opt-in SQLite cache baseline | feat | M | 10.01 | 12.01 |
| 11.02 | Add cache bypass and observability rules | feat | S | 11.01 | 12.01 |
| 12.01 | Package for `npx` and `pnpm dlx` launch | chore | M | 10.01 | 11.01, 11.02 |

## Wave 6 - Release Readiness

| ID | Title | Type | Cx | Depends | Parallel With |
|----|-------|------|----|---------|---------------|
| 12.02 | Publish operator-ready release guidance | docs | M | 10.02, 12.01 | - |

## Dependency Graph

```text
06.01 -> 07.01 -> 08.01 -> 08.02 -> 10.02 -> 12.02
      -> 07.02 -> 09.01 -> 09.02 -> 10.02
      -> 07.03 -> 08.01
                  -> 09.01

08.01 + 09.01 -> 10.01 -> 11.01 -> 11.02
                         -> 12.01 -> 12.02
10.01 -> 10.02
```

## Critical Path

`06.01 -> contract reset (07.01/07.02/07.03) -> 09.01 -> 10.01 -> 10.02 -> 12.02`

This is the minimum serial chain because the reader lane carries the largest behavior change from the current excerpt-first baseline into the canonical full-content-default release posture.

## Parallelism Notes

- Wave 2 is intentionally split into three independent contract tasks so content defaults, response metadata, and safety/privacy rules can advance together after baseline validation.
- Wave 3 keeps the SearXNG and reader lanes parallel once the shared contract reset is done.
- Wave 5 keeps optional cache work off the release critical path; packaging can begin as soon as schemas are frozen.

## Scope Resets From Legacy Plan

- Remove the legacy assumption that Waves 1-3 are complete enough to skip replanning; the canonical docs now define the source of truth.
- Remove excerpt-first behavior as an approved default; full content is now the locked default unless truncation or excerpting is explicitly requested.
- Remove backlog scope that implied local/custom source expansion, alternate transports, or other non-v1 directions.
- Treat optional SQLite cache as explicit follow-on scope instead of implicit global caching.

## Done Definition For This Plan

- Every backlog task below maps to the canonical RMCP wave structure and keeps traceability through `rmcp_id`.
- Dependencies are explicit enough for later tech-lead enrichment and orchestrator dispatch.
- No product code, docs under `docs/`, or files under `vault/ai/docs/` are changed by this planning refresh.
